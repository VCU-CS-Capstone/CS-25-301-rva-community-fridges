# How to set up a SIM card from Hologram.io

## Notes
- Hologram bills per KB, so the 0.03/MB rate will be prorated accordingly
- You can set a usage cap, to stop excessive billing. I set it at 30 MB ($1). Note that exceeding the usage rate will pause the device
- Hologram is advertised as "Pay as you Go", but there are disclaimers about overage rates -- I would like to know more about these and how they work.
    - "any data usage over the included data amount will be charged at your overage rate (billed per KB) until your SIMs are paused"
    - "SIMs with an active data session open cannot be paused until the session closes. Charges may still occur over your data usage limit"

## How Ethan did it
1. Sign in/Create an account on Hologram.io
2. Go to the dashboard
3. Click the button to activate a new SIM.
4. When prompted, enter the ICCID. As of Nov 26 2024 this is located on the bottom left of the card, under the barcode (don't punch the card out yet). 
5. Click "Add SIM", and if it is a valid SIM (i.e. you typed it in correctly), it will get added to the list below
6. Select a coverage area. As of Nov 26 2024, "Global" is the only option available.
7. Select a payment plan. As of Nov 26 2024 there are two options "G3 Standard Global flat-rate PayGo" and "Global Pay as you Go". The former option is the one that is advertised by Hologram (and is cheaper), so it's what I selected.
8. Select a usage limit. This should pause your device once the limit is reached to prevent overage charges. 
9. Decide whether or not you want to set up auto-refill. This will replenish your account credits automatically so you don't experience service interuptions when you run out of money on your account.
