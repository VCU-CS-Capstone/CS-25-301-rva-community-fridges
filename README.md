# Community Fridges Usage Data Acquisition
## About this Project
[RVA Community Fridges](https://www.rvacommunityfridges.com/) is a mutual aid group aimed at combating food insecurity throughout and around Richmond, Virginia. This repository is for the [VCU senior capstone project](https://egr.vcu.edu/capstone/) to provide a way to collect usage data of these refrigerators. Usage data will help the organization acquire funding and understand how these fridges are being utilized in their communities.

## Getting Started
The directory structure in this repository is to allow the project to have all its resources self-contained.
Open Source software should not just be a repository of code.  There are a number of directories to help you and others who will 
follow in your footsteps.  It'll also allow the Linux Foundation OMP Mentorship program to keep track of your project and get
a better understanding of the problems you encountered during the development of this project. 

| Folder | Description |
|---|---|
| Documentation |  all documentation the project team has created to describe the architecture, design, installation, and configuration of the project |
