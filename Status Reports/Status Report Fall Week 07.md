## 1) Accomplishments this week ##
   - Started the Project Proposal deliverable
   - Started making small progress on understanding how LoRa devices work

## 2) Milestones to be completed next week ##
   - Have some kind of solution ready for LoRa devices

## 3) Issues, problems or concerns ##
   - CMSC 451 tasks are taking a lot of time away from actual development, planning, and work for CMSC 441. For example, the Project Proposal was about 10 pages of writing, and that was a lot of time we could have spent working on LoRa devices.
